# CodeInPlace_FinalProject
A final project for Stanford's Code in Place Course

This program allows the user to play a simplified version of the game Tetris.
By pressing the left and right arrow keys, the user can move pieces left and right.
By pressing the down arrow key, the user can move pieces down more quickly.
If a row is completed, it was disappear and all other pieces will shift downwards.
The user gets one point for each completed row.
Once the pieces hit the top of the board, the game will end, and the user will be shown their score.
To close the board, press Q.

Future components to add:
-ability to rotate pieces
-ability to pause and restart the game
-ability to preview the next piece
-ability to start a new game once the game is over
-ability to show the score on the screen
